# Employee Management System (EMS) with Java 17 and Spring Boot

## Project Description:

Develop a robust Employee Management System using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.1.5, and PostgreSQL. 

The system will allow users to perform CRUD operations on employees, sort the data, and paginate through the employee records.

## #Technologies and Tools:

•	Java 17: Utilize the latest features and improvements in Java programming language.

•	Spring Boot 3.1.5: Leverage the Spring Boot framework for building robust and scalable applications.

•	Spring Data JPA: Implement data access and persistence using Spring Data JPA.

•	PostgreSQL: Use PostgreSQL as the database to store employee data.

•	Gradle 8.3: Manage project dependencies and build process. 

•	Liquibase: Database schema change management 

## Additional Useful Ideas:
1.	Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security to ensure that only authorized users can access the EMS.
2.	Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that the data entered by users is accurate and follows the defined format.
3.	Exception Handling: Implement custom exception handling to provide meaningful error messages to clients in case of failures.
4.	Logging: Implement logging using a logging framework like SLF4J and Logback to keep track of application activities and errors.
5.	Unit Testing: Write unit tests for the backend services and controllers to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities.
6.	API Documentation: Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger to provide clear documentation for the API endpoints or Spring RESTdocs.
7.	File Upload: Implement functionality to allow users to upload employee documents or images. Store these files securely, possibly using cloud storage services.
8.	Search Functionality: Add a search feature that allows users to search for employees based on various criteria such as name, department, or job title.


## List of Requirements:
1.	Database Setup:

10.	Validation:
    
•	Validate input data to ensure correctness and prevent malicious inputs.

•	Handle validation errors and provide appropriate error messages to clients.

12.	Exception Handling:
    
•	Implement global exception handling to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

•	Return meaningful error responses to clients in case of failures.

14.	Logging:
    
•	Implement logging to capture application activities, errors, and debug information.

•	Store logs in a central location for monitoring and analysis.

16.	Unit Testing:
    
•	Write unit tests for services and controllers to validate their functionalities.

•	Use testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito for writing unit tests.

18.	API Documentation:
    
•	Generate API documentation using Spring REST Docs.

•	Include detailed information about API endpoints, request parameters, and response structures.

19.	File Upload (Optional):
    
•	Implement file upload functionality for employees' documents or images.

•	Ensure secure storage and retrieval of uploaded files.

20.	Search Functionality (Optional):
    
•	Implement a search feature to allow users to search for employees based on specific criteria.

•	Enable searching by name, department, job title, etc.

By following these requirements and ideas, you can create a comprehensive and efficient Employee Management System using Java 17 and Spring Boot with robust backend APIs and PostgreSQL as the database.
